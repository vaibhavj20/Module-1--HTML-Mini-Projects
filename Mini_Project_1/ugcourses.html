        <li><b>Information Technology-Engineering</b> 
            <p>IT is fast developing and throws open a plethora of opportunities for professionals. The challenges and
                growth prospects for an IT professional are second to none. The
                Department of IT Engineering understands the situation and is fully equipped to meet the challenges head
                on.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Computer-Engineering</b> 
            <p>The changing development scenario and IT industry expansions are creating increasing growth opportunities
                for a Computer Engineering professional. Keeping an eye on the
                prospects, the Department of Computer Engineering is prepared to meet the future challenges.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Electronics and Telecommunication-Engineering</b> 
            <p>Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering is a popular field of study for engineering aspirants. A
                student pursuing Electronics & Telecommunications Engineering can
                broadly learn about the subgenres of this field, viz., Microelectronics, Embedded Systems / SoC,
                Communication Engineering / Networking, Digital Signal Processing, Fiber Optics &
                Photonics and Medical Electronics.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Mechanical-Engineering</b> 
            <p>Mechanical engineers design and develop everything you think of as a machine — from supersonic fighter
                jets to bicycles to toasters. And they influence the design of other
                products as well — shoes, light bulbs and even doors. Many mechanical engineers specialize in areas such
                as manufacturing, robotics, automotive/transportation and air
                conditioning.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Civil-Engineering</b> 
            <p>Civil Engineering is one of the oldest stream of Engineering in the world. Apart from being the oldest
                branch, this is one branch which incorporates expertise from several different
                streams including geotechnical sciences, structural engineering, environmental studies, hydraulics,
                transportation and hydrology. Clearly, this makes Civil Engineering — a largest
                stream in Engineering world.</p>
        </li>
